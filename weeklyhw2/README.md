# Comprehensive Exploration of C++ Variable Types

In this assignment, I conducted an in-depth investigation into variable types in C++, exploring various combinations of int, float, and double with long, short, and unsigned keywords. The C++ program generated all possible combinations and provided insights into the properties of these variables.

   1- Sizes of Variables:
        Utilized std::sizeof() to determine the sizes of int, float, double, long, short, and unsigned variables.
        Printed the sizes to understand the memory footprint of each variable.

   2- Pointers and Variable Sizes:
        Created pointers for each variable type and used std::sizeof() to ascertain their sizes.
        Highlighted the significance of pointers in understanding memory allocation.

   3- Max and Min Values:
        Leveraged std::numeric_limits() to obtain the maximum and minimum values for each variable type.
        Presented a comprehensive view of the numeric range of these variables.

   4- Auto, Const, and Constexpr:
        Explained the concepts of auto variables, const, and constexpr keywords.
        Demonstrated their application in enhancing code readability, ensuring constant values, and enabling compile-time computation.

   5- Fixed-width Variable Types:
        Explored fixed-width types like int32_t and float64_t.
        Clarified situations where fixed-width types are preferable, emphasizing portability and precision in specific scenarios.

   6- Comparison with size_t and wchar_t:
        Introduced size_t and wchar_t variable types, highlighting their differences from int and char.
        Discussed the role of size_t in representing sizes of objects and arrays, and the significance of wchar_t in handling wide characters.

The code output from the terminal has been included in the report, showcasing the results of the program execution. This assignment provided a comprehensive understanding of C++ variable types, their sizes, and the nuances associated with each type.
