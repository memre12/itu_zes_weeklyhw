# Crypto Currency Simulation 
* The code represents simulation of a cryptocurrency market, where users can interact, enter orders, and observe market dynamics over time. 

## OrderBookEntry Class:
*  **Constructor:** Initializes an OrderBookEntry with the provided parameters: price, amount, timestamp, product, orderType, and username.
* **stringToOrderBookType Function:** Converts a string representation of an order type ("ask" or "bid") to the corresponding OrderBookType enum. If the input is not "ask" or "bid," it outputs an error message to std::cerr and returns OrderBookType::unknown.
* **Comparison Functions:** Provides static comparison functions for sorting OrderBookEntry objects based on timestamp, ascending price, and descending price.
## OrderBook Class:
* **Constructor:** Reads data from a CSV file during the creation of an OrderBook instance.
* **getKnownProducts Function:** Retrieves a vector of unique product names from the order book.
* **getOrders Function:** Retrieves a vector of orders based on specified filters such as order type, product, and timestamp.
* **volume Function:** Calculates the total volume of a set of orders by summing up the product of each order's amount and price.
* **getHighPrice and getLowPrice Functions:** Find the maximum and minimum prices, respectively, from a set of orders.
* **getEarliestTime Function:** Returns the timestamp of the earliest order in the order book.
* **getNextTime Function:** Given a timestamp, finds the next timestamp in the order book. If the provided timestamp is the latest, it wraps around to the earliest timestamp.
* **insertOrder Function:** Inserts a new order into the order book and sorts the orders based on timestamps.
* **matchasksTobids Function:** Matches ask orders to bid orders, considering prices and amounts. Generates sales based on matching criteria and updates bid and ask amounts accordingly.
## Wallet Class:
* **insert_currency Function:** Inserts a specified amount of currency into the wallet. Validates that the amount is non-negative.
* **contains_currency Function:** Checks if the wallet contains a specified amount of a specific currency.
* **to_String Function:** Creates a string representation of the wallet, listing each currency and its balance.
* **remove_currency Function:** Removes a specified amount of currency from the wallet, if possible. Validates that the amount is non-negative and that there is enough currency in the wallet.
* **canFullfill_order Function:** Checks if the wallet has sufficient funds to fulfill a specific order.
* **processSale Function:** Processes a sale by updating the wallet balances based on the sale details.
## MerkelMain Class:
* **init Function:** Initializes the simulation, setting the current time and initializing the wallet. Enters a loop for user interaction.
* **Menu Functions:** printMenu, printHelp, printMarketStats, enterAsk, enterBid, printWallet, and gotoNextTimeframe functions provide functionalities as per the user's choice.
* **getUserOption Function:** Gets a user's choice from the menu, handling invalid input.
* **processUserOption Function:** Processes the user's choice from the menu and performs the corresponding action.
## csvReader Class:
* **readCSV Function:** Reads data from a CSV file and converts it into a vector of OrderBookEntry instances.
* **tokenise Function:** Splits a CSV line into a vector of strings based on a specified separator.
* **stringstoOBE Functions:** Converts a vector of strings into an OrderBookEntry instance with appropriate error handling.
## Overall Logic Flow:
* **Initialization:** The MerkelMain class initializes the simulation, sets the current time, and initializes the wallet. A loop for user interaction begins.
* **User Interaction:** Users can choose various actions from a menu, such as printing help, market statistics, entering asks/bids, printing the wallet, or advancing to the next time frame.
* **Order Book and Wallet Operations:** Orders can be entered into the order book, and the wallet is updated accordingly. Market statistics are printed based on existing orders. Sales are generated by matching asks to bids 
* **Timeframe Advancement:** The simulation advances to the next timeframe, and sales are processed.
* **Repetition:** The user can continue interacting with the simulation, making decisions based on market conditions.
